# PuckJS BLE pushbutton to MQTT bridge NodeJS

## Overview

This project is the the gateway part for our [BLE pushbutton with counter]() project.
The gateways responsibility is to listen for Bluetooth LE messages and send them to Google IoT Core. The communication with GCP is similar to our [ESP32 IoT client to connect to Google IoT Core](https://github.com/HiMinds/himinds-iot-project-embedded-esp32-mongoose-gcp-iot-client) project.
